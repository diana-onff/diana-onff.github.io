# User guide

Diana is a map of Belgium's ONFF nature reserves (Flora & Fauna, part of
WWFF) with live WWFF activation spots layered on top. It runs entirely in
your browser, works offline once loaded, and can be installed like a native
app. This guide covers every screen, how to install it, and — importantly —
what it *doesn't* do.

---

## 1. Supported platforms

Diana is a standard Progressive Web App (PWA): any reasonably modern browser
works, and no app-store install is required.

| Platform | Browser | Works? | Installable as an app? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Android | Chrome, Edge, Samsung Internet | Yes | Yes |
| iOS / iPadOS | Safari | Yes | Yes (via Share → Add to Home Screen) |
| iOS / iPadOS | Chrome, Firefox, etc. | Yes | No — iOS only allows PWA installation from Safari |
| Windows / macOS / Linux | Chrome, Edge, other Chromium browsers | Yes | Yes |
| Windows / macOS / Linux | Firefox, Safari | Yes | Browsing works fully; "install as app" isn't offered by these browsers |

GPS-based features (locate-me, session tracking) need a device with a
location sensor and browser location permission — they degrade gracefully
without it: everything else keeps working.

## 2. Installing Diana as an app

Installing wraps the same web app in its own icon and window — there is no
separate "app version" with different features.

**The short way: Settings → Install as an app.** Diana does it itself where the
browser allows it. On Android and on desktop Chrome/Edge you get an **Install
on this device** button that triggers the browser's own install prompt; a
one-time banner offers the same thing from the map screen (dismiss it once and
it stays dismissed — the Settings entry is always there).

Where a browser offers no install API, Diana shows the exact steps for *that*
browser instead of a button that would do nothing:

| Your browser | What Diana shows |
|---|---|
| Chrome / Edge (Android, Windows, macOS, Linux) | a working **Install** button |
| Safari on iPhone/iPad | Share **⬆︎** → **Add to Home Screen** |
| Chrome/Firefox/Edge on iPhone/iPad | a note that iOS only allows installing from Safari |
| Safari on macOS | **File ▸ Add to Dock** (Sonoma or newer) |
| Firefox on desktop | a note that Firefox cannot install web apps — bookmark it, or use Chrome/Edge |

Once installed, that card reads "✓ Diana is installed on this device", and
Diana opens in its own window without browser chrome, and
the service worker (see [ARCHITECTURE.md §4](ARCHITECTURE.md#4-offline-behaviour-service-worker))
keeps the map and zone data available even with no signal — handy on
activation, where connectivity is exactly what you won't have.

---

## 2.1 Starting up

Diana opens on a start screen — the activation drawing, a radio signal running
across it, a progress line and the version number — while it reads the zone data
and prepares the map. It leaves by itself the moment the map is actually drawn,
and after nine seconds regardless, because being stuck on a start screen is worse
than a bare map. Embedded in someone else's page (`?embed=1`) it does not appear
at all.

---

## 3. The screens

Bottom navigation, left to right:

### Map (◈)
The main screen. Four base-map styles, search by name or reference number, a
zone-detail panel showing only whatever attributes that zone actually has
(most zones have far less metadata than you'd expect — see
[ARCHITECTURE.md §2.1](ARCHITECTURE.md#21-the-onff-kmz)), and GPS "am I
inside this zone right now" with a warning when your GPS accuracy is poor
enough that the answer could flip. Zone reference numbers are shown as
labels by default. When a spot or zone panel is open, on a phone-sized
screen only one bottom panel is ever visible at a time — opening one tucks
the other out of the way automatically.

Some references appear as a **dashed ring with an amber dot** instead of an
outlined area. Those are real ONFF references that have no boundary in the
data — the marker is an approximate location only, which is why Diana will not
tell you whether you are "inside" one, and shows no surface area for it. They
are searchable (marked `◌` in the result list) and can be switched off under
the layers button like any other layer.

Panels at the bottom of the screen — a zone's details, a spot's details, the
heatmap panel — close by **swiping them down**, as well as with the × button.

**Spots are always on the map** — there is no switch to lose them behind: a
green pulsing icon for each currently active spot, with the callsign set larger
than the frequency underneath it, and an orange-ringed marker for each
announced-but-not-yet-active agenda item. What *is* switchable is **Lines to the
spots**, the arcs drawn from your own position to each one: useful for bearing,
but a spiderweb when there are many. That toggle sits in the layers button and
your choice is remembered. **⤢ Zoom to all spots** re-frames the map to fit
everything currently shown, including your own position.

Also on by default: **other WWFF areas**, every active WWFF reference
worldwide that isn't in Belgium (~64,600 of them), shown as blue clustered
dots that split apart as you zoom in — tap a cluster to zoom into it, tap a
single dot for its reference and name. The dots grow as you zoom in, and from
zoom 11 each one is labelled with its reference. These are always shown as points,
never as an outlined area — Diana only has real boundaries for ONFF. Switch
the layer off from the layers button, or narrow it to one country from
**Settings → Other WWFF areas** (see below).

### Spots (((·)))
A list view of the same live spots and agenda, refreshed every 30 seconds.
Tap a spot for bearing, distance, a compass heading, and both locators.
Diana shows **every WWFF spot worldwide** by default — the segmented control
above the list (also on the map's layers panel) narrows that to ONFF only or
to one specific country, and whichever you pick there is remembered as the
new default for next time (see **Spots filter** under Settings below).

### Meld / self-spot (✚)
Spot yourself. Reference number is pre-filled if you came from a zone's
detail panel; callsign and spotter are remembered from your last self-spot.
Validation mirrors WWFF Spotline's own rules exactly (callsign format and
digit requirement, frequency range, minimum reference length, a 100-character
remark limit), plus a live check that the reference you typed actually
exists and is active. A bandplan check warns if your chosen mode doesn't
match the segment your frequency falls in (e.g. SSB on a CW-only segment).
Sending opens Spotline's own confirmation page in a new tab — your spot goes
out exactly the way it would if you'd used Spotline directly.

### Settings (⚙)
Your callsign, portable callsign (e.g. `ON3VZ/P`) and Maidenhead grid locator
(with "take it from GPS" and format validation). There is deliberately no
setting for where the map opens — **it always opens where you are**, exactly as if you had
pressed the ◎ button next to the zoom controls: your position marker appears and
Diana tells you straight away whether you are standing in a zone. There is no
setting for this, because there is no sensible other answer for a field app.
Declining the location permission costs you nothing and produces no complaint:
the map falls back to your locator, then your callsign's country, then all zones
— never a blank world view.

This is also where you set your **language** (the seven below, or "follow the
browser"), your **Spots filter** — worldwide by default, or narrowed to ONFF
only or to one specific WWFF country, the same choice as the quick control on
the Spots screen, kept in sync with it — your **Other WWFF areas** setting
(worldwide by default, or narrowed to one country — a separate choice from
the Spots filter, since one decides which map *points* you see and the other
which live *spots* you see), and where you **install Diana as an app**.
Everything here is local to this device; see §Limitations.

### Admin (⛭, hidden by default)
For repository maintainers only — publishing new data and generating embed
codes. Hidden until `?admin=1` is used or the Diana logo is tapped five
times. Full documentation: [ADMIN.md](ADMIN.md).

### Session (◉)
Start a tracked activation session: a timer, percentage of time spent inside
the zone, and on finishing, a GPX file (with per-point "inside the zone?"
and GPS-accuracy extensions) plus a text summary — useful as activation
proof. The GPS track is generated and downloaded entirely on your device and
is never uploaded anywhere by Diana.

### Heatmap (▦)
Colours every zone by either recency of last activation or total QSO count,
sourced from the published ONFF activation-history sheet. This colouring
only applies while you're on this screen — leaving it returns the map to its
normal single theme colour, so the Heatmap screen doesn't change what the
Map screen looks like.

### Rules (☰)
The IARU Region 1 bandplan per band, with CW/Digi/SSB/FM segments drawn as a
visual bar, FT8 frequencies marked, and WWFF's own preferred SSB/CW
calling frequencies per band highlighted.

## 4. Languages

Diana is available in English, Dutch, French, German, Danish, Italian and
Spanish. Set yours in **Settings → Language**; the flags row at the top of the
map does the same thing. Language is chosen, in order: the `?lang=` URL
parameter, then your saved setting, otherwise **English**. Your browser's
language is used only if you explicitly pick **Follow the browser** — so with
no choice made, Diana is predictably English rather than whatever a borrowed
device happens to be set to. Switching language re-renders every screen
immediately — nothing requires a page reload, and nothing is left in the old
language. Zone names themselves are never translated: they're
official names and belong in activation logs exactly as ONFF publishes them.

---

## 5. Embedding Diana on another page

Diana can be dropped into any web page as an iframe — the ONFF blog, a club
site, anything that accepts HTML.

```html
<iframe src="https://<your-domain>/?embed=1&prov=antwerpen&lang=en&spots=1"
        width="100%" height="600" style="border:0"
        loading="lazy" allow="geolocation"></iframe>
```

| Parameter | Effect |
|---|---|
| `?embed=1` | hides Diana's own navigation and header, so it fits inside someone else's page chrome |
| `?lang=en\|nl\|fr\|de\|da\|it\|es` | forces a language, overriding browser detection |
| `?ref=ONFF-0104` | opens directly zoomed to one zone |
| `?prov=antwerpen` | zooms to one Belgian province |
| `?spots=1` | turns the live-spots map layer on |
| `?world=1` | turns the "other WWFF areas" map layer on |
| `?admin=1` | reveals the Admin panel (not meaningful in an embed; documented here only for completeness) |

Both layers default to **off** inside an embed regardless of Diana's own
default elsewhere, so an `<iframe>` already published somewhere never changes
appearance on its own — each layer only appears in an embed when its
parameter is explicitly present.

The Admin panel (§Admin above) includes a small form that builds this exact
snippet for you from a province, language and spots choice — see
[ADMIN.md §Generating an embed snippet](ADMIN.md#generating-an-embed-snippet).

## 6. Limitations

**Everything is stored on this one device, in this one browser — nothing
syncs.** Your callsign, grid locator, home-view preference, language choice,
and (if you enabled it) a remembered Admin token all live in that browser's
local storage. If you open Diana on your phone and then on your laptop, you
will need to enter your settings again on the laptop — the two are
completely independent, and Diana has no account system to tie them
together. Clearing your browser's site data, or using a private/incognito
window, also clears these settings.

**GPS session tracks are not backed up anywhere.** The GPX file from an
activation session exists only as the download it produces — save it
somewhere you'll keep it.

**Live data depends on third parties Diana doesn't control.** Spots, the
agenda, and the activation-history heatmap all come from WWFF Spotline and a
Google Sheet maintained by the ONFF coordinator (see
[ARCHITECTURE.md §2](ARCHITECTURE.md#2-where-the-apps-own-data-comes-from)).
If either is unavailable or changes shape, the relevant screen says so
rather than showing stale data silently — but there's nothing Diana itself
can do to bring either one back online.

**Not every zone has full details.** Roughly half of the 932 mapped ONFF
zones have no attributes beyond a name and reference number — this is a gap
in the underlying source data, not something the app is hiding.

**And not every reference has a boundary at all.** 16 of ONFF's 948 active
references have no polygon in the KMZ; Diana shows those as a dashed ring at
the position the WWFF directory gives. Retired references are not shown at all.
Which references exist comes from the WWFF directory and refreshes by itself;
the boundaries come from a file an administrator uploads, so a brand-new park
can appear as a ring first and gain its outline later.

**Data usage terms.** The zone boundaries and activation figures shown in
Diana come from ONFF, WDPA, Flemish/Walloon government sources, and WWFF
Spotline, and remain their owners' data — Diana's *code* is open source
(MIT), but the *data and content* may not be freely redistributed or reused
elsewhere without permission. See [LICENSE](../LICENSE) for the exact terms
and the honest technical caveat about what a web map necessarily has to send
to a visitor's browser.
